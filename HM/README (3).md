# HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT
The provided Python project is a basic hospital management system. It allows users, primarily hospital administrators and patients, to perform various tasks related to hospital operations
Functionality for Hospital Administrators (Admin class):

Patient Registration: Hospital administrators can register new patients by collecting their personal information such as name, age, gender, address, contact number, symptoms, and the last four digits of their Aadhaar number.

View Patient Details: Administrators can view the details of a registered patient, including their personal information and appointment details.

Doctor Information: The system provides information about available doctors, their categories (e.g., GENERAL, CARDIOLOGY, NEUROLOGY), and booking time slots.

Treatment: Administrators can mark treatments as done for patients and assign medicines to them.

Billing: The system calculates and displays the bill for a patient, including the cost of prescribed medicines and a fixed token fee.

Functionality for Patients (patient class):

Request Appointment: Patients can request an appointment with a doctor in a specific department and time slot. The system checks for availability and schedules the appointment if possible.
This hospital management project can be used by hospital administrators to efficiently manage patient registrations, appointments, and treatments. Patients can use it to request appointments with their desired doctors. However, it's important to note that this project is relatively basic and might need further development and enhancements to be used in a real-world hospital setting.
